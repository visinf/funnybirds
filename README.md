> :warning: **Disclaimer**: This repository will containt the full code to reproduce our work, including the dataset rendering, the custom evaluations, and the framework code for all methods (code coming soon). As this code can be a bit unclear, we additionally provide a separat [FunnyBirds framework repository](https://github.com/visinf/funnybirds-framework) that provides the minimal working code to run your own evaluations on the FunnyBirds framework. If you just want to run the framework evaluation, we thus recommend using the FunnyBirds framework repository.
